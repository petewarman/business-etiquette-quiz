			"question": "You’re at a trade show in Beijing hoping to find a distributor for your luxury brand. You’ve had a great chat with a potential Chinese customer and now’s the time to give her your business card. Do you:",
			"options": [
				"take a card out of your back pocket and write your mobile phone number on it?",
				"point out that paper-based business cards are so old hat nowadays — is it OK if you just send her your details via your smartphone instead?",
				"carefully remove your specially prepared Chinese business card from a silver case in your briefcase, then present it by holding it carefully in front of you, with both hands?"
			],
			"answer": {
				"index": 2,
				"copy": "You’ll find that across Asia, the presentation of business cards is taken very seriously. Don’t ever write on a business card, or, even worse, shove it in your back pocket. Offering a card casually from a back pocket or with one hand is seen as insulting — it indicates that you don’t really care about the relationship. So offer it with respect, politeness and humility — and, for extra kudos, get it translated."

			"question": "You’ve received an approach from a company in Oman via their UK agent, and you fly out to Muscat to meet them. You’re eager to get straight down to business but your contact seems more interested in small talk — how many children do you have etc. Should you:",
			"options": [
				"answer his questions then move on to talk about business, you only have limited time in Muscat",
				"answer, but don’t ask him anything — you don’t want to seem intrusive",
				"respond in kind by asking him about his children, holidays, experience of the UK, favourite restaurants in Muscat, and so on, for the next 20 minutes or so"
			],
			"answer": {
				"index": 2,
				"copy": "It’s very rude not to spend a lot of time at the start of any meeting in the Middle East without the proper greetings — hello, how are you, how is your family, and so on. You might consider these invasive questions but politeness demands that you answer them. No matter how much of a rush you are in to get to the point, you can never dispense with this initial greeting period."

			"mapY": "37.2",
			"question": "You’re desperate to work with a consultancy in Germany, but you’re not sure you can afford them. You’ve made them a good offer during a face-to-face meeting — now they say they’re ‘thinking about it’. How can you persuade them?",
			"options": [
				"write an enthusiastic email reiterating how passionate you are about their work and what a great opportunity it would be for them",
				"write an email asking when they expect to make a decision — after all there are plenty of other consultancies you can approach",
				"do nothing except send a polite thanks for the meeting. It’s best to wait and see"
			],
			"answer": {
				"index": 2,
				"copy": "Germans don’t like pushy business techniques, and they don’t respond well to wild passionate appeals. They like to take their time when considering a request, so take a step back and let them think about it."

			"question": "You’ve spent a year organising meetings for your buying trip to Chennai, India — but the manager you’re meeting seems distracted. He’s constantly answering the phone or chatting to employees who wander in while you’re trying to talk. How should you react?",
			"options": [
				"Stop talking and politely wait for your host to finish his conversation/call",
				"Just carry on but wrap things up quickly as he clearly isn’t interested",
				"Ask him not to respond to any distractions — what you’re saying is important"
			],
			"answer": {
				"index": 0,
				"copy": "These kinds of interruptions are normal in India, as it’s seen as rude to ignore a phone call or a request. It’s not an indication that your host isn’t listening or is too busy."

				"Go to the meeting and apologise for being ill",
				"Cancel or rearrange the meeting"
			],
			"answer": {
				"index": 2,
				"copy": "Turning up to a business meeting with a cold would be seen as insulting in Japan and could end your chances of winning a contract. Blowing your nose is also a no no. If you have a cold, cancel the meeting."

			"options": [
				"By his title, whatever that is — Professor, Dr, Your Excellency — and his surname",
				"By his first name, to establish rapport",
				"By his full name but without the title — titles sound too formal and you want to appear friendly"

			"options": [
				"just wait until your meeting participants show up — and don’t mention their lateness",
				"wait and when they do arrive, ask politely whether they had been stuck in traffic",
				"tell the receptionist that you’re just going to get a coffee and go for a wander around to pass the time — after all, if your participants are late, it won’t matter if you are, too"
			],
			"answer": {
				"index": 0,
				"copy": "It’s fine for Russians to be late — often, that lateness is a subtle test to see how patient you are. But it’s not OK for you to be late too, or for you to criticise their timekeeping."
